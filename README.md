# Inventory Manager
Inventory manager to keep track of Amazon freebies
I made this quick inventory system to keep track of my freebies that I get from Amazon.
The script is compatable with barcode scanners that also input enter after scanning the item.
Just scan the FNSKU sticker on your freebie item in the desired input mode.
Rapid mode lets you just scan back to back and Detailed mode has you input the item name, ASIN, price, and quantity.
Everything should be self explanatory but you can hmu on Discord at DrowningWhale#0001 for any info.

# Planned:
- CSV import and export
- Explore automatic ASIN, product name, and price
- Adjust search to look in product name
- Adjust search to allow for multiple hits with a selection menu
